## 🧩 Featured Projects

- [Bookstore Website](https://github.com/KingHendrie/Bookstore-Website)  
  A small dynamic bookstore, built on node where I experimented with more advanced concepts.
  Such as: Migrations, models, layout partialization, etc.

- [Study Tool](https://github.com/KingHendrie/Markdown-Flashcards)  
  Studying was never my strong point. It feels boring and is never interesting enough.
  Thus, I created a small browser based studying tool to review Markdown-based flashcards and notes, with some nifty features as well!
